        <h3>Coding Projects</h2>
        <p>I work on various software projects both for graduate research and side projects, mostly for data analysis purposes.  I do most of my work in Python, but also have experience in C, D3.js, HTML, C++, MATLAB, and IDL.</p>

          <h4><a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~ccs2142/uhrs/visuals.html">Urban Health Repository Systems (UHRS) startup</a></h4>
          <p>I developed an interactive data visualization tool using D3.js as the technology lead in a data-driven startup as part of the <a href="https://sipa.columbia.edu/challenge-grant">Columbia University SIPA Dean's Challenge</a>.  The mission of the startup was to educate the public, especially Asthma sufferers, about potentially harmful environmental exposures, such as air quality and building material, so that they can make better decisions and obviate exacerbations.</p>

          <p>The team collected data about Asthma cases in New York City, as well as environmental factors that have shown evidence to be linked to exacerbations.  With tools, such as the one in the link above, we aimed for the public to learn about these exposures in order to mitigate their potential harm.  In the example, the amount of harmful boiler fuel used to heat buildings is geographically compared to Asthma related ER visits.  Additionally, we were developing a notification system with up-to-date information, such as air quality.  Unfortunately, the team is no longer working towards creating a startup company, but work continues on the data visualization tool as a potential research platform.</p>

          <h4><a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/cstoafer/inductance-measurements/blob/master/Determine%20mu.ipynb">Determining the magnetic properties of ferritic material</a></h4>
          <p>As part of the research goals of my graduate research group, we are interested how magnetic material affects plasma behavior when placed near the plasma surface.  To model this, we need to know some magnetic properties of the material, specifically the relative magnetic permeability with different external magnetic field strengths.  I setup an experiment, took the measurements, and analyzed the data to describe these magnetic properties.</p>

          <p>The results of the measurements were surprising while performing the experiments, so I kept the <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/cstoafer/inductance-measurements/blob/master/Determine%20mu.ipynb">Ipython Notebook</a> with chronological analysis to show my thought process.  I also wrote up a <a href="Determine_mu_material.pdf">report</a> to provide a straightforward summary of the results.</p>

          <h4>Thomson scattering measurement analysis</h4>
          <p>In the Thomson scattering diagnostic, that I built for my graduate research, the temperature and density are measured in the plasma.  This is done by spectrally resolving the Doppler shifted light scattered from the hot electrons, which is done by detecting 4 spectral bins of the spectrum.  The temperature and density are determined by performing a maximum likelihood method to fit of the expected spectrum to the measured data.</p>

          <h4>Thomson scattering data acquisition</h4>
          <p>I setup the system for automating timing, detection, data acquisition, and data storage for Thomson scattering measurements.  This involves an Arduino circuit and coding to control the laser trigger and detecting the scattered light.  The signal is taken with oscilloscopes, which I setup to be automatically read by a computer.  the data is then saved to a data tree used for all the data storage in the laboratory.  We use a database called <a href="http://www.mdsplus.org/">MDSplus</a>, which was developed specifically for fusion research experiments.  A separate script is used to read the data from the tree, analyze it, and display it every plasma shot.</p>

          <h4>Survival prediction of the Titanic - Kaggle project</h4>
          <p>From an introductory Kaggle project, I used features known about Titanic passengers to predict if they survived.  I performed feature engineering and used Random Forest to fit the model for predicting survival.</p>
