        <h3>Coding Projects</h2>
        <p>I work on various software projects both for graduate research and side projects, mostly for data analysis purposes.  I do most of my work in Python, but also have experience in C, D3.js, html, C++, MatLab, and IDL.</p>

        <h4>Thomson scattering measurement analysis</h4>
        <p>In the Thomson scattering diagnostic, that I built for my graduate research, the temperature and density are measured in the plasma.  This is done by spectrally resolving the Doppler shifted light scattered from the hot electrons, which is done by detecting 4 spectral bins of the spectrum.  The temperature and density are determined by performing a maximum likelihood method to fit of the expected spectrum to the measured data.</p>

        <h4>Thomson scattering data acquisition</h4>
        <p>I setup the system for automating timing, detection, data acquisition, and data storage for Thomson scattering measurements.  This involves an Arduino circuit and coding to control the laser trigger and detecting the scattered light.  The signal is taken with oscilloscopes, which I setup to be automatically read by a computer.  the data is then saved to a data tree used for all the data storage in the laboratory.  We use a database called <a href="http://www.mdsplus.org/">MDSplus</a>, which was developed specifically for fusion research experiments.  A separate script is used to read the data from the tree, analyze it, and display it every plasma shot.</p>

        <h4>Survival prediction of the Titanic - Kaggle project</h4>
        <p>From an introductory Kaggle project, I used features known about Titanic passengers to predict if they survived.  I performed feature engineering and used Random Forest to fit the model for predicting survival.</p>
